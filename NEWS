Exchange Connector 2.0.0, 2004-09-13
------------------------------------

Changes to Ximian Connector between 1.4.x and 2.0:

	* Major UI change to reflect changes in Evolution 2.0:

		* Mail, addressbook, calendar, and task folders are
                  now viewed in separate components.

		* If you have Connector installed, there is a fifth
                  component available named "Exchange" which you can
                  use to do Exchange-specific operations, such as
                  editing folder permissions or changing your
                  Out-of-Office status.

		* Other users' folders that you have subscribed to
                  will show up in the corresponding components. (Eg,
                  another user's Calendar will show up in the Calendar
                  component.)

		* Public folders that you have added to your "Favorite
                  Public Folders" hierarchy will also show up in the
                  corresponding components. (You can add folders to
                  the favorites hierarchy from either Outlook or
                  Connector.)

	* You can now change your Exchange/Windows password from
          Evolution, using the "Change Exchange Password" command in
          the Exchange component. Also, if your site uses password
          expiration, Connector will recognize when your password has
          expired, and allow you to change it.

	* Connector is now localized to Albanian, Arabic, Bangla,
          Czech, Danish, Dutch, British English, Canadian English,
          German, Greek, Finnish, Gujarati, Hungarian, Japanese,
          Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Serbian, Spanish,
          Tamil, Turkish, and Ukranian. (Translations have also been
          begun for several other languages.)

	* Various bugs fixed
