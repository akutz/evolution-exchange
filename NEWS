Evolution Exchange 2.3.5  2005-07-11
------------------------------------

	* The Exchange button has been removed. Now users should be able to 
	  seamlessly get the full functionality of evolution-exchange through 
	  the Mail/Contacts/Calendar/Tasks components of evolution.

	  One major change being that most of the Exchange Account wide 
	  operations have been now moved to the Evolution Account Editor
	  window under the "Exchange Settings" tab for an Exchange Account.

Evolution Exchange 2.3.4  2005-07-01
------------------------------------

	* The Exchange server communication code moved to evolution-data-server
		* The server communication code [ lib/xntlm and most of 
		storage ] has now been moved to evolution-data-server under 
		servers/exchange. This will enable developers to now write 
		plugins in evolution that can communicate with the Exchange 
		servers.
	* Favorite folder handling is now made as part of Folder Subscriptions
	  To mark a public folder as your favorite you now need to subscribe it.

Changes to Evolution Exchange between 2.0.x and 2.2.0

	* Many major features added

		* Password expiry warnings. You can now get prior notifications

		* Display folder sizes. You can now get the size of each folder
		  on the server which can help you reduce the appropriate
		  folder contents when you are nearing your quota usage limit.
		* Offline handling. You can now access your mails, contacts,
		  calendar and tasks items in offline mode. Contacts, Calendar
		  and Tasks are only read-only in this release, while Mail
		  messages can be created and will get sent once you get back
		  into online mode.
		* Integrating ximian-connector-setup with account setup. You
		  can now create your exchange account by giving the OWA url
		  from the Edit->Preferences dialog, same as it was in
		  ximian-connector-setup.
		* Support for calendar attachments. You can now attach your
		  meeting agenda and other files to your meeting requests. You
		  can also attach documents to your appointments.
		* Calendar tracking options. You can set options on your
		  meeting requests to get notifications when the meeting
		  request has been delivered or read.
		* 64 bit support. Evolution Exchange can now also be used on a
		  64 bit machine.
		* Plenty of 2.0.x bug fixes.

Exchange Connector 2.0.0, 2004-09-13
------------------------------------

Changes to Ximian Connector between 1.4.x and 2.0:

	* Major UI change to reflect changes in Evolution 2.0:

		* Mail, addressbook, calendar, and task folders are
                  now viewed in separate components.

		* If you have Connector installed, there is a fifth
                  component available named "Exchange" which you can
                  use to do Exchange-specific operations, such as
                  editing folder permissions or changing your
                  Out-of-Office status.

		* Other users' folders that you have subscribed to
                  will show up in the corresponding components. (Eg,
                  another user's Calendar will show up in the Calendar
                  component.)

		* Public folders that you have added to your "Favorite
                  Public Folders" hierarchy will also show up in the
                  corresponding components. (You can add folders to
                  the favorites hierarchy from either Outlook or
                  Connector.)

	* You can now change your Exchange/Windows password from
          Evolution, using the "Change Exchange Password" command in
          the Exchange component. Also, if your site uses password
          expiration, Connector will recognize when your password has
          expired, and allow you to change it.

	* Connector is now localized to Albanian, Arabic, Bangla,
          Czech, Danish, Dutch, British English, Canadian English,
          German, Greek, Finnish, Gujarati, Hungarian, Japanese,
          Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Serbian, Spanish,
          Tamil, Turkish, and Ukranian. (Translations have also been
          begun for several other languages.)

	* Various bugs fixed
