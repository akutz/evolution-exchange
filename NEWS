Changes to Ximian Connector between 1.4.6 and 1.4.7

	* (Initial open source release)

	* Removed requirement for license files

Changes between 1.4.5 and 1.4.6

	* Messages sent from one Connector user to another on the same
          server will now have a "Received" header.

	* Fixed a bug that resulted in a harmless (but annoying) crash
	  when quitting when using GNOME 2.4 or later

Changes between 1.4.4 and 1.4.5

	* The contents of calendar folders are now cached to local
          disk between sessions, which will greatly improve
          performance for users with very full calendars. [#39601]

	* Exchange 2003's "Forms-based authentication" mode is now
          supported.

	* Improved the account autoconfiguration wizard in several
          ways:

		* Gives an explicit error message if the server is an
                  Exchange 5.5 server, rather than just a generic
                  failure message [#41538]

		* Gives an error message if the server has been
                  configured with the IIS Lockdown Wizard in a way
                  that will prevent Connector from working correctly.
                  [#46057]

		* Tries appending "/exchange" to the given
                  URL/hostname if no path was provided and trying to
                  connect with no path failed [#45198]

		* Gives the correct error message now if you give a
                  non-existent username [#35930]

	* Fixed a bug that could cause "new mail" notifications from
          the server to be dropped sometimes. [#47702]

	* Fixed two obscure crashers [#47754, #47765]

Changes between 1.4.0 and 1.4.4

	* Added a German translation

	* Fixed several editing problems in the folder permissions
          dialog. [#43404, #43818, #43822]

	* Connector now ignores folders that are marked "hidden" on
          the Exchange server (for compatibility with Outlook XP).
          [#44100]

	* Fixed a problem that made appointments that had other
          appointments attached to them not show up in the Calendar.
          [#44193]

	* Fixed a crash when creating a contact with no name. [#44254]

	* Fixed a display problem in the "Out of Office" configuration
          dialog. [#44439]

	* Made Connector break large Exchange server requests into
          smaller chunks, to avoid problems with some Exchange
          servers. [#44823]

	* Fixed problems that made some contacts created or edited in
          Evolution not autocomplete correctly in Outlook. [#45080]

	* Fixed a hang while sending mail via Exchange [#45435]

	* Fixed a problem modifying tasks in public folders [#46191]

	* Plugged various memory leaks

Changes between 1.2.x and 1.4.0

	* Ported to GNOME 2 and made compliant with the GNOME Human
          Interface Guidelines.

	* Support for "Out of Office". If your account is marked "Out
          of Office" when you start up Evolution, it will ask you if
          you want to switch it back to "In the Office". You can also
          toggle the state and edit your "Out of Office" message from
          the Preferences dialog.

	* A new simplified Exchange account configuration dialog will
          be used to configure your account in certain circumstances.
          You can force it to run by running "ximian-connector-setup"
          from the command line

	* If your account is moved from one Exchange server to
          another, Connector will now update its information
          automatically rather than requiring you to edit the settings
          in the Preferences dialog.

	* Connector does a more thorough job of setting up your
          default folders when creating a new account: your Exchange
          Contacts folder and the Global Address List folder are added
          to the Autocompletion Folders list, and the account is set
          up to automatically use the Exchange "Drafts" and "Sent
          Items" folders rather than the local ones.

	* Connector now gives better error messages when it cannot
          connect to the Exchange server in certain cases (for
          example, if the server requires SSL but the user did not
          enable it.)

	* Clicking "Send/Receive" will now always update the content
          of the currently-displayed folder. (Before it would
          sometimes update the unread count in the folder tree without
          actually making the new messages visible in the folder.)

	* If a user who has never connected to his Exchange account
          before connects to it for the first time using Connector,
          the default folders (Inbox, Calendar, etc) will get names in
          the user's system locale rather than always getting English
          names. (This matches the behavior of Outlook and OWA.)

	* Connector can now be built as a statically-linked, relocatable
	  binary, for sites that want to install it in a different prefix
	  or on an unsupported Linux distribution.

	* Many small bugfixes
