	* storage/exchange-hierarchy-somedav.c: Split this out from
	exchange-hierarchy-foreign; new abstract class for hierarchies
	that are a subset of webdav folders from somewhere else.

	* storage/exchange-hierarchy-foreign.c: Now a subclass of
	ExchangeHierarchySomeDAV.

	* storage/exchange-hierarchy-favorites.c: New subclass of
	ExchangeHierarchySomeDAV for displaying "favorite" Public Folders.
	(Currently displays simple Outlook favorites correctly, but
	doesn't handle more complex cases, and no way to edit things.)

	* storage/exchange-account.c (exchange_account_connect): Create a
	favorites hierarchy.

	* lib/e2k-utils.c (e2k_entryid_to_permanenturl): New (to create a
	WebDAV permanent URL from a favorites entry)

	* storage/exchange-config-listener.c (add_sources)(remove_sources):
	Calling e_source_list_sync() after forming the sources for all the 
	folders for each component, instead of calling it for each folder 
	in a loop.
	Fixes bug #58320

	* Ximian Connector 1.5.7, first GPL release.
