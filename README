This is the Ximian Connector for Microsoft Exchange, which adds
support for Microsoft Exchange 2000 and 2003 to Evolution.


This version is for Evolution 1.5, and is at the moment very unstable
and less featureful than the 1.4 version. You are probably looking for
the older version, which can be found on the connector-1-4-branch in
CVS.
