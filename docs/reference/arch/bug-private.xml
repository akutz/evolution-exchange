<para>
<application>Outlook</application> allows the user to mark items in
folders as "private". (<application>Evolution</application> allows
this in Calendar and Task folders, but not Contact or Mail folders.)
Private items are not supposed to show up when other users view the
folder, unless they have been given explicit permission to view
private items in the <link
linkend="ximian-connector-delegation">Delegates</link> dialog.
</para>

<para>
Bizarrely, <application>Exchange</application> does not actually
enforce this. Thus, when a user subscribes to another user's folder,
Connector has to check whether or not the user is supposed to be able
to view private items, and filter them out if not.
</para>

<note><para>
In <application>Outlook</application> and
<application>OWA</application>, if you are not allowed to view private
calendar items, they still show up in the calendar, but with the
summary changed to something like "Private item", and they can't be
opened. See <ulink
url="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=256066">Bug
256066</ulink>.
</para></note>

<para>
The information about who can view private items is stored with the
<link linkend="ximian-connector-delegation">delegates</link> data on
the other user's mailbox. 
<link linkend="ExchangeHierarchyForeign"><classname>ExchangeHierarchyForeign</classname></link>
checks that data, and sets its
<structfield>hide_private_items</structfield> flag accordingly. (If it
cannot read the delegates data, it assumes that the user is not
allowed to view private items.)
</para>

<para>
<link linkend="ECalBackendExchange"><classname>ECalBackendExchange</classname></link>
and
<link linkend="EBookBackendExchange"><classname>EBookBackendExchange</classname></link>
check the <structfield>hide_private_items</structfield> flag on the
<link linkend="ExchangeHierarchy"><classname>ExchangeHierarchy</classname></link>
of the folder they are working with, and set their
<structfield>private_item_restriction</structfield> fields
accordingly:
</para>

<informalexample><programlisting>
	hier = e_folder_exchange_get_hierarchy (cbex->folder);
	if (hier->hide_private_items) {
		cbex->private_item_restriction =
			e2k_restriction_prop_int (
				E2K_PR_MAPI_SENSITIVITY, E2K_RELOP_NE, 2);
	} else
		cbex->private_item_restriction = NULL;
</programlisting></informalexample>

<para>
That field is incorporated as part of the restriction in
every <command>SEARCH</command> that they do, so that if
<structfield>hide_private_items</structfield> was set, the private
items will be excluded from the <command>SEARCH</command> results.
</para>
